    <h2><span>Biography</span> </h2>
    <p>Emory Andrew Tate III (born December 1, 1986) is an American and British social media personality, businessman, and former professional kickboxer. Following his kickboxing career, he began offering paid courses and memberships through his website and later rose to fame as an Internet celebrity, promoting an "ultra-masculine, ultra-luxurious lifestyle". A self-described misogynist,[4] Tate's controversial commentary has resulted in his suspension from several social media platforms.[5][6]

        On December 29, 2022, Tate and his brother, Tristan, were arrested in Romania along with two women; all four are suspected of human trafficking and forming an organized crime group. Romanian police allege that the group coerced victims into creating paid pornography for social media.[7]
